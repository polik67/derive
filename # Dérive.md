## Site 1
-https://pdftotext.com/
<br>
-Got to this URL from by following a link on Blackboard
<br>
-Design seems plain with minimal colours and lots of white space, seems everything is in the same box dwn the middle
<br>
-Navigation system is very easy, classic buttons to upload or download are apparent and resemble what we know we can click on to interact with, everything is easy to find at uploading is present as soon as you open the site with other upload options underneath as buttons
<br>
-All rectangle buttons are interactive along with there social media icons at the bottom of the page
<br>
-This site is useful as its one purpose really is to convert pdf files to text files
<br>
-There isn't much I'd change about this site as it's basic with one use except for maybe making the buttons a tad bigger

## Site 2
-https://www.facebook.com/
<br>
-First url led to no other sites, opened up facebook desktop to see a message
<br>
-It looks dated as it seems like its always looked the same, maybe timeless as the same blue is used for all their brand associated things, the top bar and headers are in the same blue
<br>
-The navigation system is quite troublemsome, I find that when I need to change one privacy setting or any setting it takes awhile to find and more than 2 steps, things like the search bar are relatively common, search for anything like places, people or groups
<br>
-Most of the site is interactive, the home page filled with posts and videos can be liked, shared, enlarged and shortcut and explore 
option bars are down the left hadn side of the feed
<br>
-I feel like this site is crowded with many ads, pushing things of interest down
<br>
-I'd think about changing how posts and the feed are sized and laid out as the current one feels cramped with info in the small space it has

## Site 3
-https://tasty.co/recipe/double-crunch-shrimp?fbclid=IwAR0Fiq2o6s_eovmv-xNw-fpdFumMflniYX3-WdVRB-TFB_7GCAUoJU9I3S8
<br>
-A link to a recipe website I followed from facebook
<br>
-The site looks a bit boring with a simple blue bar across the top with dropdowns and the site logo
<br>
-The site has a familiar system with dropdown menus and arrows and a search bar
<br>
-This site feels bland to me, it serves its purpose though and gets to the point, lots of white space
<br>
-I'd maybe change their related recipes portion at the bottom of the page, as it feels crowded and recipe names under the picture are a bti small

## Site 4
-https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ahzmvn/guy_devours_a_dead_rat/
<br>
-Sadly followed this link i received from a friend
<br>
-The layout and site looks fairly sleek and organized 
<br>
-Navigation is common with a search bar at the top, side bar buttons, and icons to navigate to things like all posts, trending, home or messages
<br>
-Alot is interactive, posts can be up or downvoted for points right next to them with interactive links below to comment, share and more. Top icons are interactive aswell to naviagte around the site
<br>
-I feel informed with this site, the home page shows trending posts which can mainly be politics or news in general which is nice to be aware of and any posts of interest to you appear as well
<br>
-One thing I'd change is the font size of titles, comments etc

---
## Site 5
-https://imgur.com/
<br>
-Got here from my last site, Reddit, where there a link in a post 
<br>
-The site looks trendy and reminds me of a pinterest but for teens etc
<br>
-There is a familiar navigation system, the msot being the search bar as most sites have it and an explore feature at the top with trending topics and interactive squares
<br>
-Pretty much the whole site is interactive, large green buttons in the corners for posting and log in, the main feed is pretty big showcasing new posts in columns
<br>
-This site can be interesting as it seems to mainly be for posting things of interest or searching for them, the site feels cosy in a way with the dark purple bar at the top and the rest of the site being dark shades
<br>
-If I had to change one thing about this site it would be maybe making the size in between posts larger so everything doesnt feel too cramped
